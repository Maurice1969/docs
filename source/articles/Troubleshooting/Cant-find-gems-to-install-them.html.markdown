# Can't find gems to install them

Sometimes you might see errors like the following.
For example:

~~~
Could not find safe_yaml-0.9.2 in any of the sources
~~~

Please make sure that the version of the gem you want to install there wasn't yanked from [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/){:target="_blank"}
