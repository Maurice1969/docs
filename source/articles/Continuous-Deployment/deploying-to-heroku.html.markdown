## [Settings](#settings){:name="settings"}
Within Codeship you are able to configure [Deployment Pipelines](/continuous-deployment/create-deployment-pipelines/). You can easily add a Heroku Deployment choosing Heroku as deployment method.

You are asked to enter the **name of your Heroku application** and your **API key** you get from Heroku. You need to create the application on Heroku first.

By clicking on **more options** you can configure additional settings.

### URL of your Heroku Application
We are checking after each deployment if your app is up. Therefore we call (wget) either the default *.herokuapps.com url or the url you specified here.

*Basic Auth* \\
If this url requires basic out please enter: ```http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@YOUR_URL```

## [Run migration after the app is deployed](#migration){:name="migration"}
You can either specify within the more options section to run the migration during the Heroku deployment. If you want to run your migration after the deployment you can add a [Script Deployment](/deployment/deploying-with-your-own-script/index.html) below the Heroku deployment and run the migration there.

~~~shell
heroku_run bundle exec rake db:migrate my_herokuapp_name
~~~
