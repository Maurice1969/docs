## PHP
We use **PHPENV** to manage PHP versions. We currently have 5.3 , 5.4 and 5.5 installed. By default we use 5.4
These are aliases that are pointing to the specific 5.x.x versions we have installed.

***Do not rely on the specific versions we have as this can change any time and could break your build.***

You can change the version you want to use by running **phpenv local PHP_VERSION** in your setup commands.
For example
    phpenv local 5.5

### Dependencies and Extensions

You can install dependencies through pear and composer. Extensions can be installed through pecl. If you need any other tools please send us a message.
### Pear
    pear install pear/PHP_CodeSniffer

### Composer
    composer install

### Pecl
    pecl install -f memcache

### Phpenv rehashing
If you install a new executable through a pear package make sure to run
    phpenv rehash

so phpenv is aware of the new executable and sets it up correctly
