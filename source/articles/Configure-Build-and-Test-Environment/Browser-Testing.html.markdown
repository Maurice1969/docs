## Browser Testing

## Firefox
Firefox 24 is installed and available in the PATH.

## Chrome
Chrome and Chromium are both available in the PATH and in /usr/bin/google-chrome and /usr/bin/chromium-browser

## Selenium
Firefox and Chrome should both work fine with Selenium. To support Selenium with Chrome the [Chrome Driver](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) is installed as well. Please provide your own Selenium driver (e.g. [selenium-webdriver](https://github.com/vertis/selenium-webdriver) for Ruby) and keep it up-to-date. This will ensure that it will work with the latest version installed on Codeship.

## PhantomJS
Phantomjs 1.9.2 is installed and available in the PATH.

## CasperJS
Casperjs 1.0.3 is installed and available in the PATH.

## SlimerJS
