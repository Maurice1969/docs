# Create Deployment Pipelines

+ [Script Deployment for custom deployments / commands](#script-deployment)

On Codeship you are able to define **deployment pipelines**. You can configure branches that kick off your deployments.

Additionally you can add multiple deployments within one branch configuration. That lets you deploy for exmaple first to a staging app and if that succeeds to the production. That process is fully automated on Codeship and in case of errors you get immediatelly notified.

## [Set up a branch configuration](#setup-branch){:name="setup-branch"}
Go to your ```Project Settings > Deployment``` to set up your deployment.

Add a branch you want to deploy and save it.

Choose your hosting provider or deployment method.

Fill in the deployment configuration and hit save in the top right corner.
![Save Deployment](deployment/save_deployment.png)

On the next push to that branch (in this case 'master') and if all tests pass the deployment will be triggered.

You can now add additional deployments or configure another branch you want to deploy.

## [Add additional deployment methods](#additional-deployments){:name="additional-deployments"}

You are able to add multiple deployments for one branch. They will be execute sequentially and can be re-ordered by drag and drop on the deployment symbol.

## [Deploy another branch](#deploy-another-branch){:name="deploy-another-branch"}
If you want to create a deployment pipeline for another branch you can do so by clicking on "Add a branch to deploy" and enter the branch name.

By saving that branch you are now able to add your deployment methods for that branch.

## [Edit Branch Settings](#edit-branch){:name="edit-branch"}
By clicking on "Edit Branch Settings" you can change the branch name or delete that branch.

## [Use Script Deployment for custom deployments / commands](#script-deployment){:name="script-deployment"}

You can use the <%= docs_link_to "Script Deployment", "/continuous-deployment/deploying-with-your-own-script/" %> to run your custom deployment commands or to execute other tasks right after or prior a deployment.
